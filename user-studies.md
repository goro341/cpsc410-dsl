# User study setup

User studies were conducted as follows

* Provide three simple language examples
    * Building an index page
    * Building a table
    * Building two pages with shared header 
* Asking the users to vocalize and draw what they thought the result of each example was
* Ask the user to incrementally build a simple site
    * Create a page
    * Create a header
    * Add hello world


## Feedback
We received mixed feedback. When approaching programmers in the class, we were told "this is so confusing" and "our DSL is better". They picked at syntactic inconsistencies in casing and this slowed them down. But in illiciting feedback from a non-technical audience, they were able to quickly build our test case as they relied more heavily on our docs. Given more time, it would be nice to investigate this discrepancy.  

We also were told that a two statement lang was probably two tiny even for a tiny language. So in response we added "LOAD" which opens up a bunch of new use cases. We didn't get a chance to user test LOAD.
